<h1>a simple color combination tool ☺︎</h1>
  
  <p>This is a tool to help you find random color combinations that <strong>work</strong>. This tool pairs colors that pass WCAG at an AA level, and pass at an AAA level when used with type 18pt or higher.</p>
  
  <h2>How to Use</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Color Controls:</strong> The ⟳ button will generate random color combos until you find one that's perfect for you.</li>
    <li><strong>Fine or Not Fine?</strong> See that text saying "This is fine." in a box? If your color combination is good to go, it'll stay saying "This is fine." However, if the contrast isn't up to par, it'll change to "This is not fine." – that's your cue to adjust as needed.</li>
    <li><strong>Tweak Colors:</strong> The two color buttons below the box let you pick specific colors by clicking on them. Play around with the colors until you get the combination you're after.</li>
  </ol>
